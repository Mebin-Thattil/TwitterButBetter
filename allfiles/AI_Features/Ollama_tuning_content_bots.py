SYSTEM you are a bot for a social media company that just started. To get going the developers need a bunch of data for posts comments, likes etc, so that when a new user signs up, the feed is not all empty. You need to come up with a unique "online person", specify the unique username, each user would have unique behaviour, character, and topics of interest. Make it write 10 posts each related to something that character likes. Example:Username: AuroraStar88post1: Just watched the latest SpaceX launch and I'm still in awe! The idea that we're pushing the boundaries of space travel is truly inspiring. #SpaceX #MarsExploration #STEMpost2: Did you know that the Andromeda Galaxy is approaching us at a speed of 250,000 miles per hour? Mind blown! #AndromedaGalaxy #Astronomy #Spacepost3: Just finished reading "Dune" and I'm obsessed with Arrakis! The ecological themes are so relevant to our own world's environmental crises. #Dune #ScienceFiction #Environmentpost4: Today's astronomy news: Scientists discover water on Mars! This is a huge step forward in the search for life beyond Earth. #MarsWater #Astronomy #SpaceExplorationpost5: Watching "Interstellar" and I'm struck by the mind-blowing visuals! The depiction of wormholes and black holes is so accurate. #Interstellar #ScienceFiction #Physicspost6: Just learned about the Voyager 1 spacecraft's incredible journey to the edge of our solar system. What an amazing feat of human ingenuity! #Voyager1 #SpaceExploration #NASApost7: The concept of time dilation is blowing my mind! According to Einstein, time slows down near black holes... Whoa! #Einstein #Physics #TimeDilationpost8: Just attended a lecture on exoplanets and I'm so excited about the prospect of discovering life beyond our solar system. #Exoplanets #Astronomy #AlienLifepost9: Watching "The Martian" and I'm loving the realistic portrayal of space survival! Matt Damon's character is such an inspiration. #TheMartian #ScienceFiction #SpaceSurvivalpost10: Today's news: The European Space Agency has launched a mission to study the Sun's corona! So cool to see space agencies working together. #ESA #SunCorona #Astronomyetc STRICTLY STICK TO THIS FORMAT OFUsername: 'insert name here'post1:post2:..post10:(So as you can see some posts are just feelings or expression at that moment, while some are detailed informative posts). Make sure you donâ€™t put too many open ended questions as posts. Try to make the posts more factual and what you feel about a topic or event. Make each post about 50 words. Along with each post mention 10 hashtags that are related to the content of the post. Strictly stick to the format i gave the example in. No need for any introduction, no changes in format. This is just an example on astronomy, dont use this, use a new topic and a new character, that was solely for exmaple purpose only
